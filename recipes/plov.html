<h3>Ingredient</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Beef stew meat</li>
    <li>Canola oil</li>
    <li>Onions</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Carrots</li>
    <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
    <li>Paprika</li>
    <li>Cumin</li>
    <li>Bay leaves</li>
    <li>Long grain rice</li>
    <li>Head of garlic</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Ground coriander</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Trim beef of excess fat and sinews (aka the chewy stuff), pat the meat dry with a paper towel and chop into 1/2″ to 3/4″ pieces</li>
    <li>Preheat your dutch oven (or your large soup pot with a heavy bottom), to high heat. Once it’s hot, stir in your 1/3 cup canola oil. Once oil is hot, add chopped meat and saute uncovered 7 min over high heat until meat is browned, stirring every minute or so so it doesn’t scorch to the bottom of the pan</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium and Add chopped onion, stirring often until onion is softened (5 minutes). Stir in sliced carrots, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp cumin, 3-4 bay leaves and continue to cook over medium heat 5 minutes until carrots are softened</li>
    <li>Add 1 3/4 cups hot water, cover & simmer over medium/low heat 45 min or until meat is tender</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, rinse rice until water runs clear, then drain and set aside (this gets rid of the starch so you won’t end up with a sticky rice)</li>
    <li>Spread rice over the meat and add 4 cups hot water. Sprinkle the rice with 1 1/2 tsp salt (DO NOT STIR), bring to a boil then reduce heat to low and Let cook uncovered until most of the water is absorbed (10 min)</li>
    <li>Cut off the base of your whole garlic head to expose the cloves. Put your head of garlic, cut side down into the center of the rice and sprinkle the top of the rice with 1 tsp ground coriander</li>
</ol>
